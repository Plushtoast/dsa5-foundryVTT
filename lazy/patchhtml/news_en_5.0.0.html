                Foundry has now been released in version 11 and DSA is already ready for it. Besides some new features, however, there are some minor problems, as with every new major version jump:
            <ul class="dsalist">
                <li>Foundry has changed how it handles status effects. As a result, leftover statuses on characters may appear twice or no longer function properly. These may have to be removed manually.</li>
                <li>Foundry now handles unlinked tokens differently (tokens whose actor is independent of the source). This can cause scenes to get a bit buggy or large tokens before migrating to V11, removing and re-placing these should improve performance.</li>
            </ul>

                A free adventure for FOUNDRY VTT with extensive new map material.
                A small coven of witches suffers from the machinations and lust for power of its vicious leader. The warlock, despite being a man, managed to take over the leadership of the coven and all attempts to get rid of him have failed.
                One of the witches, however, does not want to resign herself to this. She wants her freedom back and is desperately looking for a way to trick her leader.
                So it needs brave heroes who are ready to help and assist the coven. And what hero would turn down such a request?

                The Principality of Kosch is known for its breathtakingly beautiful, pristine landscapes and the outstanding hospitality of its inhabitants. But in Revelation from Heaven, your heroes have little time to enjoy the rural idyll, for they soon discover that things are not going right in the small village of Oldenbridge. Apparently, not all inhabitants honor the laws of the gods equally, and only one can bring light into the darkness and solve a monstrous crime - your heroes!  
Includes the fully playable adventure module "Revelation from Heaven" prepared for Foundry VTT with numerous journal entries, as well as
