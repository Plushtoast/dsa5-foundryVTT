<h1 id="weapon-advantages-and-disadvantages-as-well-as-the-same-for-armor">Weapon advantages and disadvantages, as well as the same for armor </h1>
<p>Active effects of weapons and armor can now also be declared as advantages or disadvantages via their properties.<br>
These effects only have an effect if the corresponding focus rule is also activated in the settings.</p>
<p>Moreover weapons can now contain multiple attack types. You can now chose whether you attack with your sword-hammer using the hammer side or the blade without the need to have multiple weapons in the inventory.</p>
<p>We will make the necessary adjustments to all official elements where possible.<br>
We will start with the Aventurian Armory I and II, hopefully available soon after this patch.</p>
<p>This will be followed by all RSH armories.</p>
<p>Please make sure to migrate any equipment that has already been added to characters.</p>
<h2 id="new-active-effects">New Active Effects </h2>
<p>There are some new ways to modify equipment and characters with Active Effects:</p>
<ul class="dsalist">
<li>There are now Active Effects for modifying combat techniques. The KTW, AT/FK, TP and PA value can be modified.</li>
<li>There is a new Active Effect Key to adjust the armor against other combat techniques (e.g. if a chain mail is attacked with slashing weapons, the armor value changes by +1).</li>
<li>There are now some new possibilities to adjust the throw modifiers in the combat dialog (e.g. +1TP for short ranged attacks)</li>
<li>Weapons can now also adjust these modifiers for the current attack only</li>
<li>The confirmation roll of attacks can now be modified</li>
<li>Weapons can now have situational modifiers to damage, parry and attack</li>
<li>Weapons can now modify combat maneuvers PA, AT, TP and defense malus</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="improvements">Improvements </h1>
<ul class="dsalist">
<li>A new item type “Book” has been introduced. Possibly for the soon to be released module “Aventurian Library”</li>
<li>The Foundry enricher @Embed now works almost the same as the DSA enricher @EmbedItem</li>
<li>The master functions can now also be displayed in the canvas controls (e.g. adverse conditions) if you do not want to use one of the DSA token hotbars. The setting for this can be found in the token hotbar settings.</li>
<li>You can now drag and drop crafting items onto collection samples in the player menu, similar to the Forge, to track their production. As soon as the collection sample is complete (QS 10), a corresponding message will appear in the chat, from which the finished item can also be dragged and dropped.</li>
<li>Right-clicking on a request-to-throw message in the chat now triggers a blind throw to the game master.</li>
<li>The DSA Initiative Tracker now also shows icons for effects currently on the respective actor</li>
<li>The setting for displaying the results of comparison tests has been expanded. It is now possible to always display the result of attacks and comparison tests (with or without critical details) regardless of the game master's dice mode. Please note that your setting from the previous version will be lost.</li>
<li>The physique of elves and dwarves is now taken into account for certain weapon types. Elves get deductions on two-handed slashing weapons and swords, dwarves on fencing weapons and bows. In addition, dwarf or elf can now be entered in the domain field of weapons, whereupon elves or dwarves receive further deductions. We may or may not adjust the weapons from official modules.</li>
<li>The basis for traps (new item type) has been created, more on this in the following patches.</li>
<li>The foundation for Foundry v12 Application V2 has been laid. Some dialog windows should now shine in a new design. The adaptation to the DSA style will be done later. Please inform us if this has led to broken layouts.</li>
<li>There is now an improvised Dark Mode Skin here: <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dsa5-darkmode">Dark Mode</a></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="bugfixes">Bugfixes </h1>
<ul class="dsalist">
<li>The modifier for automatic visibility is now correctly taken into account when opening the throwing dialog.</li>
</ul>
