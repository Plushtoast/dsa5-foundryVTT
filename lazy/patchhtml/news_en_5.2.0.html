    <h2>Foundry reinstall necessary!!!</h2>

                With the switch from Foundry 10 to 11 it was necessary to completely reinstall Foundry. Some of you may
                have gotten around it intentionally or unintentionally. Unfortunately this causes some problems.
                If you see errors such as those in the ticket below, it is necessary to delete Foundry (do not simply
                install over it) and reinstall it. Pay attention to backups and do not delete the foundrydata folder.
                See for example: https://github.com/Plushtoast/dsa5-foundryVTT/issues/1532
