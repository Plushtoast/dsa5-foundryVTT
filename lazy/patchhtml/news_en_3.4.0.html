            <p>
                The next version for Foundry (v10) is already available as a prototype. The dark eye is not compatible with this version. Don't even try to update and just wait until a compatible version has been anounced. Foundry v10 has large underlying changes which
                will create a lot of work for the migration. If you don't wait you'll see a lot of bugs, error messages and you also might encounter data loss...
