                A free adventure for FOUNDRY VTT with extensive new map material.
                A small coven of witches suffers from the machinations and lust for power of its vicious leader. The warlock, despite being a man, managed to take over the leadership of the coven and all attempts to get rid of him have failed.
                One of the witches, however, does not want to resign herself to this. She wants her freedom back and is desperately looking for a way to trick her leader.
                So it needs brave heroes who are ready to help and assist the coven. And what hero would turn down such a request?
