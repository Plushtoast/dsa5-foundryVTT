    <div class="row-section">
        <div class="col sixty">
            <p>Special abilities, Advantages, Disadvantages and Gear can now contain macros for on use effects. If such element contains a macro you can roll the macro using a button on the item sheet or the character sheet. Some of those on-use effects
                already have been added to the new core module version. You can try the new flame sword, eternal light or leader abilities for example. The flame sword now summons a new item in the inventory to use in combat and there is an attached active
                effect to remove the sword again. If you activate the times-up module these summoned items will also automatically vanish once the effect duration has finished. These functions are stored in a new compendium and don&apos;t work without
                the context of an actor. Make sure to migrate your actors to profit from those new functions!<br> We will gradually add this new feature to existing modules.</p>
            <p>The next modules to profit from this new feature will be Gods of Aventuria I and Aventurian Magic I, then II each and then the other books (it takes time...).</p>
            <p<b>We highly recommend the module &quot;times-up&quot; for automation</b> , this module automatically expires effects in the combat once their duration comes to an end.</p>
                <p>This and the new possibilities for active effects will allow making a big chunk of abilities automatable. Make sure to <b>use the migration of abilities</b> for the upcoming module patches.</p>

    <h2 class="mume-header" id="improved-light-macro">Improved light macro</h2>

    <div class="row-section">
        <div class="col sixty">

            <p>The light macro included in the core module has a few new features. You can now add custom presets to predefine other light sources and vision settings. Also, active effects on the actors can now modifiy the vision and light distance in &quot;auto&quot;
                mode. On use effects for torches and spells like Flimflam can now activate a light on the source token. Also there is a new auto mode for the vision setting called &quot;compensation&quot; (thanks Qowy). This is the new recommended mode.
                The darkness setting of the scene gets modified by the compensation. E.g. for actors with darksight the darkness in the vision is always 0.2 less than for normal actors. This topic is a little complicated but very useful (!) once you understand
                how to use this properly. We totally recommend VTTom&apos;s Tutorial. Playtesting made fiddling with vision settings mostly redundant. Don&apos;t forget to activate the token HUD for lights, so you can add lights to your guards quickly!</p>

            <p>Diseases can now be dragged onto a character sheet. Only the gamemaster will be able so see those diseases on the status tab. You can now track the suffering of your victims much more easily. More enhancements for diseases are planned for
                the future, like remaining time of sickness.</p>

    <div class="row-section">
        <div class="col sixty">


            <p>The Dark Eye now supports the module &quot;Automated Animations&quot;. This module adds the possibility to add sound and an animation to every item. It is very useful especially for combat animations like swords and bows hitting the enemy.
                The module itself has some dependencies like the JB2A module which already has a lot of animations in its free version. It is very easy to setup but we recommend to watch VTTom&apos;s upcoming video on this feature.

    <div class="row-section">
        <div class="col sixty">


            <p>We added some support to calculate the distance between tokens. You can enable this feature in the master menu. Currently this limits the distance where loot items and merchants can be accessed by players to less than two tiles. Also this
                now automatically sets the range modifier for ranged attacks in the attack dialog. We&apos;ve got a few other ideas about what we can do with this feature in the future too &#x1F603; Only works with scene units of Yard/Schritt.</p>
