<h1 id="important-improvements">Important Improvements  (11/15/2023)</h1>
<h2 id="special-abilities-of-traditional-artifacts">Special Abilities of Traditional Artifacts </h2>
<p>Special abilities of traditional artifacts that have been assigned to a traditional artifact and transfer an effect
    (active effect) to the character will now only be applied if the traditional artifact is also equipped. This means
    that special abilities such as power focus (magic costs are reduced by 1AsP when the magician’s staff is used) will
    work automatically. To apply the change, the special abilities must be migrated (e.g. via the world destroyer).
    However, this also means that any existing effects on a magician’s staff regarding, for example, power focus should
    be removed if necessary.</p>
<h2 id="extended-categories-for-special-abilities">Extended Categories for Special Abilities </h2>
<img src="systems/dsa5/lazy/patchimages/5.2.0/speccats.webp"/>
<p>Special abilities now also have the extended subcategories of the rulebook. This makes it possible to search more
    specifically for certain special abilities in the library. In addition, behavior dependent on the subcategory can be
    better defined in the future. It may take a little while for all modules to adopt these changes. At this point, I
    would like to express my sincere thanks to BriGen, who has taken on the task of assigning and checking the
    respective categories.</p>
<h2>More predefined functions for journals and similar text blocks</h2>
<img src="systems/dsa5/lazy/patchimages/5.2.0/embed.webp"/>
<p>In journals, the pay, be paid, and pay adventure points functions can now be integrated with the following keywords:
</p>
<pre class="language-text">@AP[15]: Pay 15 adventure points to players
@Pay[15]: Demand 15 silver from players
@GetPaid[15]: Pay 15 silver to players
</pre>
<p>Please note that all players selected in the game master menu are targeted here. With the formatting shown above, all
    three commands receive a standard text in the journal. This can be replaced by the following syntax
    @Pay[1500]{Diamonds under the pillow}.</p>
<p>A description of items can now be integrated into journals using the following syntax:</p>
<pre data-role="codeBlock" data-info="html" class="language-html html"><code>@EmbedItem[Item.mIgQ4hvCiqahFcrD]
</code></pre>
<p>This can be done most quickly by dragging and dropping the item onto the journal page and then replacing the UUID
    with EmbedItem. Then the graphics, description, and details of the item are displayed. This is also possible for
    actors.</p>
<p>Journal tests (@Rq,@Gc,@Ch) can now be modified with additional fluff text. For example, test requirements with
    application areas are possible. Example: @Rq[Kraftakt -5]{Kraftakt (Big bowel movement)}</p>
<p>Here is the translated text:</p>
<h2 id="global-modifiers--master-menu">Global Modifiers &amp; Master Menu </h2>
<img src="systems/dsa5/lazy/patchimages/5.2.0/globalmod.webp"/>
<p>In the master menu, global modifiers can now be created. These are applied to all filtered samples.<br>
    This results in the following possibilities:</p>
<ul class="dsalist">
    <li>Dynamically changing the difficulty level in battles. Are your players too strong or too weak? Create an effect
        "Stunted/Masterful" and give the NPC a bonus/penalty on their attacks.</li>
    <li>Your players are in a demonic sanctuary? Create an effect "Suction of the Lower Hells" and give them a penalty
        on their liturgies.</li>
    <li>Severe setbacks have plunged the companions and players into moral depths? Give your players an effect
        "Hopelessness" and give them a penalty on everything.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, folders can now be created in the master menu to sort tracked actors.<br>
    For example, important NPCs can be moved to a folder called "Dramatis Personae".</p>
<p>Here is the translated text:</p>
<h2 id="dsa-45-journal-layout">DSA 4/5 Journal Layout </h2>
<p>The graphics for paper and the master box have been slightly improved so that they no longer fray and work better
    with large blocks.</p>
<p>With the new layout of the regional game aids, there is also a new layout for the journal browser and journals. This
    is activated by default. However, the skin can also be reset to the previous layout via the settings.</p>
<h1 id="world-destroyer-und-backups">World destroyer und Backups </h1>
<img src="systems/dsa5/lazy/patchimages/5.2.0/zerstoerer.webp"/>
<p>Foundry is constantly advancing to improve your gaming experience. To achieve this, updates and major changes are
    occasionally necessary. Some of these require significant changes to the data structures of your game. This progress
    requires regular adaptation of these structures. Unfortunately, errors are also possible, which can destroy your
    painstakingly maintained data (actors, journals, etc.). To prevent this, it is recommended that you back up your
    data. Your images and other files must be backed up manually (but are usually not affected by changes to data
    structures).</p>
<p>In general, you can distinguish between:</p>
<ul class="dsalist">
    <li>A backup using the integrated backup function of Foundry. See <a
            href="https://foundryvtt.com/article/backups/%E2%80%9D">Backups</a>
        for more information.</li>
    <li>A backup of the raw data (the Foundry backup function is now recommended instead) (see the following path: <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmbxMmqNNXU%E2%80%9D">Only YOU can prevent Foundry File Loss</a>). Since Foundry v11, the Foundry world must be closed to do this!</li>
    <li>Or the backup via the world destroyer (you can also find it in the settings), which only copies your actors to a
        compendium. You can then restore this compendium later. Please note that this tool only backs up the actors. All
        other data must be backed up manually. After you have made your backup, you can also use this tool to update the
        actors. To do this, select the appropriate options under the Migration tab.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Attention: The process can only be reversed with a backup. Make sure you always wait until backup or
        migration functions are complete!</strong></p>

<h2 id="aggregated-test-and-information-item-improvements">Aggregated test and Information Item Improvements </h2>
<img src="systems/dsa5/lazy/patchimages/5.2.0/grpcheck.webp"/>
<p>Information items can now also manage results for critical successes, botches, and failures.<br>
    In addition, a collection sample item can now also be prepared and posted as a group collection sample. They now
    also include fields for success and partial success, which are automatically output after the roll.</p>
<h2 id="direct-exchange-between-characters">Direct exchange between characters </h2>
<img src="systems/dsa5/lazy/patchimages/5.2.0/trade.webp"/>
<p>Items can now be passed on to other players via the token bar and the context menu in the inventory. A target must be
    selected via the token bar, while a target can be selected from a list in the inventory.<br>
    The two actors can adjust the selection of items and complete or cancel the trade. A GM must be logged in to
    complete the trade.</p>
<h2 id="brawls">Brawls </h2>
<img src="systems/dsa5/lazy/patchimages/5.2.0/brawl.webp"/>
<p>For groups that prefer brawling to relaxing and enjoying themselves in taverns, the brawl rules have now been
    implemented.</p>
<p>The game master can start a brawl by clicking on the fist in the combat tracker or the DSA initiative tracker. As a
    result, all characters involved in the fight receive an additional supply of life points equal to their current LP.
    Attacks now only deduct points from this, until the character is either defeated or the fight ends. At the end of
    the fight, all participants suffer a portion of the damage suffered according to the rules on their regular LP.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a new subcategory “Brawling” for combat special abilities. These special abilities are only
    displayed during attack and parry rolls when a brawl is active. The brawling abilities have been automated as much
    as possible in the game master’s workshop.</p>
<h1 id="improvements">Improvements </h1>
<ul class="dsalist">
    <li>The journals of the Drachenritter Einsteigerbox have been slightly revised (graphics, details, tokens).</li>
    <li>Consumables now also accept a list of values separated by semicolons. According to the QS of the item, a
        non-linear relationship between price and QS can be represented. For example, a price of 10;50;100;120;160;5000
        with QS 4 would cost 120 silver.</li>
    <li>Equipment items can now be paid for directly by drag &amp; drop from the library if coins are specifically
        picked up at the start of the drag.</li>
    <li>Spells, talents, and equipment items in the inventory now have a context menu (right-click). In addition to
        existing functions such as delete and edit, there is now room for new functions (e.g. trade).</li>
    <li>The journal browser now has forward and backward buttons similar to journals.</li>
    <li>The detail filter of the library now has a dropdown to filter by modules. This makes it easier to see what has
        been added with the addition of a new module.</li>
    <li>The token bar can now remove effects that exist on all selected tokens at the same time.</li>
    <li>The message generated when a player interacts with a merchant (can be activated in the settings) now contains a
        clickable link to the traded item.</li>
    <li>Minor improvements for the "Naked" layout skin.</li>
    <li>First aid wounds now includes a function to enter the QS as a temporary healing bonus for the next regeneration
        on the marked targets. To do this, the talents must be migrated (e.g. via the world destroyer).</li>
    <li>The library toggles have been visually improved a bit (5.1.4).</li>
    <li>Buttons to apply damage can now be activated in the settings in addition to the options in the context menu of
        chat cards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the improvements and bugfixes:</p>
<ul class="dsalist">
    <li>The round change in the DSA Initracker is now displayed more clearly.</li>
    <li>Active effects of special abilities can now include macros for <strong>after a roll</strong> and <strong>after a
            comparison test</strong>. These can modify the data of the roll in a complicated way. The first special
        ability to benefit from this is "Tradition (Elves)", in that the duration is now doubled. This functionality may
        be extended to other item types.</li>
    <li>When damage is rolled for a weapon with a target, the resulting damage is now calculated directly and can be
        applied.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="bugfixes">Bugfixes </h1>
<ul class="dsalist">
    <li>The token bar can be reactivated after being deactivated.</li>
    <li>Automatic blindness in darkness 1 should now work correctly in sight automation (5.1.5).</li>
    <li>The library now filters some categories more precisely.</li>
    <li>Recurring effects (e.g. burning) now show the token name in their chat message. If the message is only displayed
        to the GM (adjustable in the settings regeneration (KR)), the GM sees the name in this format: Tokenname (actor
        name), provided the two names are different.</li>
    <li>Concentrating and reloading should now use the token name instead of the actor name in the chat message.</li>
</ul>
