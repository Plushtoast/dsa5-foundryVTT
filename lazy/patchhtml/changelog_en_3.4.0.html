    <div class="row-section">
        <div class="col sixty">
            <p>TDE now includes its own combattracker. It opens by default on the start of each combat and shows the
                next five turns. You can access the character sheet, target the tokens and everything else similar to
                the default combattracker. Moreover it allows to track actors which are not using their action
                immediately but instead are waiting. It can be disabled via the settings on your disposal.</p>
