                Where is my big update? We are currently trying to implement as many special abilities as possible. This consumes a lot of time but will result in great automation improvements. Compendium 2 has a huge coverage for effects and on use effects and gods
                of aventuria will soon too. Among a lot of other things those effects can now create a resistance roll check (e.g. don't get stunned while falling down). Not long ago Magic of Aventuria I received a similar update, so make sure to use
                the migration to update your special abilities!

            <p>
                The token hotbar has been improved. You can now control it's direction and button size in the system settings and drag it to another location of your preference. Right click on the drag button changes the layout. Scrolling on the drag button changes the
                size. Moreover it does now contain additional buttons for "on-use-effects", system effects and active effects. You can increase the level of effects with a left click and remove or decrease the level with a right click. In addition you
                can add new system effects quickly via the add button. This also works if you selected several tokens at the same time.
